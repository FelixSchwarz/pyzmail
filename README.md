pyzmail
=======

pyzmail is a high level mail library for Python 2.x & 3.x.

It provides functions and classes that help to parse, compose and send emails.
pyzmail exists because there is no reason that handling mails with Python
should be more difficult than with Outlook or Thunderbird.

pyzmail hides the difficulties of managing the MIME structure and of the
encoding/decoding for internationalized emails. pyzmail is well documented,
has a lot of code samples and includes 2 scripts: pyzsendmail and pyzinfomail
